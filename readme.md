### Where to Buy Alternatives

**If Amazon links don't work or out of stock:**

**ESP32:**
- AliExpress: Search "ESP32 WROOM development board"
- eBay: Often cheaper but slower shipping
- Local electronics stores: Higher price but immediate

**LiFePO4 Batteries:**
- Search: "6V 6Ah LiFePO4 USB charging BMS"
- Alternative brands: Ampere Time, ExpertPower, Renogy
- **Must have:** Built-in BMS + USB charging

**XL4015 Buck Converters:**
- eBay: Often $8-10 for 5-pack
- AliExpress: Cheapest but slow shipping (4-6 weeks)
- Search: "XL4015 5A buck converter adjustable"

**WS2812B LED Strips:**
- BTF-Lighting Store (direct): Best quality, custom lengths
- AliExpress: Cheaper, verify 5V and 60 LED/m
- eBay: Quick shipping options
- **Important:** Get 5V version, not 12V!

**Wire & Connectors:**
- Local electronics stores (RadioShack alternatives)
- Hardware stores for basic wire
- Online: Adafruit, SparkFun (higher quality)

### Important Specifications

**When Buying LED Strips:**
- ✅ **Must be 5V** (not 12V or 24V)
- ✅ WS2812B chipset (not WS2811 or SK6812)
- ✅ 60 LEDs/meter minimum (144/meter is better but pricier)
- ✅ White PCB preferred (better light diffusion on foam)
- ✅ IP30 (non-waterproof) is fine for indoor use

**When Buying Batteries:**
- ✅ 6V nominal voltage (5.5-6.4V range)
- ✅ 6Ah capacity minimum (5Ah okay, 7-10Ah better runtime)
- ✅ **Must have built-in BMS** (critical for safety)
- ✅ USB charging port (makes life easier)
- ✅ F1 terminals (0.187" blade terminals)
- ✅ LiFePO4 chemistry (safer than Li-ion)

**When Buying Buck Converters:**
- ✅ XL4015 chipset (not LM2596 - less efficient)
- ✅ 5A minimum output current
- ✅ 4-38V input range (must handle 6V battery)
- ✅ Adjustable output (1.25-36V)
- ✅ LED indicators preferred

### Tips for Buying

💡 **Money Saving Tips:**
1. Buy in bulk (3-packs, 10-packs) - cheaper per unit
2. Check eBay for converters - often half Amazon price
3. Get foam board locally (avoids shipping cost)
4. One wire kit lasts 5+ builds
5. Extra ESP32s make good spares or other projects

⚠️ **What NOT to Compromise On:**
1. **Battery quality** - Must have BMS, buy from reputable seller
2. **LED strip** - Cheap strips fail, stick to WS2812B
3. **Wire gauge** - Don't go thinner than 22 AWG for data, 18 AWG for power
4. **ESP32 authenticity** - Clones often have WiFi issues

🎯 **Best Value Strategy:**
- Order all at once (save on shipping)
- Get 2-packs/3-packs even for 1 sign (spares are invaluable)
- Check eBay before Amazon (often 20-30% cheaper)
- Wait for sales (Prime Day, Black Friday)
- Bundle items from same seller (combined shipping)

## 🔌 Hardware Setup

### Required Components

**Core Components:**
- **ESP-WROOM-32** development board
- **WS2812B LED matrices** (20×20 pixels each)
- **470Ω resistors** (one per board) - between ESP32 pin and LED data input

**Power Options (choose one):**

**Option A: Wall Power (Permanent Installations)**
- **5V power supply** (adequate for number of boards)
  - Estimate: 60mA per LED at full brightness (400 LEDs × 60mA = 24A max)
  - Typical usage at 25% brightness: ~5A per board
  - 1 board: 10A 5V power supply
  - 2 boards: 20A 5V power supply
  - 4+ boards: Multiple power supplies
- **1000µF capacitor** (across power supply terminals)

**Option B: Battery Power (Portable) ⭐ Recommended for portability**
- **LiFePO4 6V 6Ah batteries** (1 per board for 83 min runtime)
  - Built-in BMS protection
  - USB charging (use any phone charger)
  - Weight: Only 0.7 lbs per battery
  - Cost: ~$12-15 each
- **XL4015 DC-DC buck converters** (1 per board)
  - Converts 6V battery to 5V for LEDs
  - 96% efficient
  - Cost: ~$10-12 for 3-pack
- **3D printable battery mount** (STL file included)

**Optional but Recommended:**
- **Logic level shifter** - Converts 3.3V ESP32 signals to 5V for WS2812B
- **On/off switch** - For battery configurations
- **Voltage meter** - Monitor battery level

### Wiring Each Board

**Wall Power Configuration:**
```
ESP32 GPIO Pin → 470Ω Resistor → LED Matrix Data In
                                  
Power Supply 5V+ → LED Matrix VCC
Power Supply GND → LED Matrix GND
                 → ESP32 GND (IMPORTANT!)
```

**Battery Power Configuration:**
```
ESP32 GPIO Pin → 470Ω Resistor → LED Matrix Data In

Battery 6V+ → XL4015 IN+
Battery GND → XL4015 IN- → ESP32 GND (IMPORTANT!)

XL4015 OUT+ (5.0V) → LED Matrix VCC  
XL4015 OUT- → LED Matrix GND → ESP32 GND (common ground!)
```

**Critical:** All grounds must be connected together:
- Battery ground (-)
- XL4015 OUT-
- ESP32 GND
- LED board GND

**See "Battery Power" section for complete battery wiring diagrams**

### Multi-Board Chain Configuration

**Option 1: Individual Control** (Recommended)
- Each board has its own GPIO pin
- Better control and troubleshooting
- Can display different content on each board

```
ESP32 GPIO 5  → Board 1 Data In
ESP32 GPIO 16 → Board 2 Data In
ESP32 GPIO 17 → Board 3 Data In
... etc
```

**Option 2: Daisy Chain** (Current code uses this)
- All boards connected in series on one GPIO
- Simpler wiring but limited to sequential display

```
ESP32 GPIO 5 → Board 1 Data In
Board 1 Data Out → Board 2 Data In
Board 2 Data Out → Board 3 Data In
... etc
```

```

### XL4015 Setup Procedure

**CRITICAL: Set voltage BEFORE connecting LEDs!**

1. **Charge battery fully via USB**
   - Red LED = Charging
   - Green LED = Fully charged (6.3-6.4V)

2. **Connect battery to XL4015 input**
   - Battery (+) → XL4015 IN+
   - Battery (-) → XL4015 IN-

3. **Adjust output voltage**
   - Use multimeter on OUT+ and OUT-
   - Turn potentiometer clockwise to increase
   - Set to exactly **5.0V** (±0.05V okay)
   - Mark the setting with paint pen

4. **Connect LEDs**
   - XL4015 OUT+ → LED Board VCC
   - XL4015 OUT- → LED Board GND **AND** ESP32 GND (common!)

5. **Test at low brightness**
   - Start at 10% brightness
   - Verify voltage stays 4.95-5.05V
   - Feel XL4015: should be warm, not hot
   - Gradually increase to 25%

### USB Charging (Built-in)

**How to charge:**
1. Disconnect battery from LED sign (or use on/off switch)
2. Plug USB cable into battery charging port
3. Connect to any USB power adapter
4. Red LED indicates charging
5. Green LED indicates fully charged

**Charge times:**
- 1A adapter (phone charger): 6-7 hours
- 2A adapter (iPad charger): 3-4 hours ⭐ Recommended
- 3A adapter (fast charger): 2-3 hours

**What you can use:**
- Phone charger (works!)
- iPad/tablet charger (faster)
- USB power bank (portable charging)
- Computer USB port (slow but works)
- Any 5V USB adapter

### Battery Voltage Guide (LiFePO4)

**Check battery level:**

| Voltage | Charge | Action |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 6.4V | 100% | Fully charged |
| 6.3V | 90% | Excellent |
| 6.2V | 70% | Good |
| 6.1V | 50% | Half |
| 6.0V | 30% | ⚠️ Recharge soon |
| 5.8V | 10% | ⚠️ Stop using, charge now |

- Battery may be depleted - recharge

**Short runtime:**
- Battery not fully charged (check voltage)
- High current draw (measure actual current)
- Battery aging (normal after 1000+ cycles)
- Cold temperature reduces capacity

**Battery won't charge:**
- Try different USB cable
- Try different USB adapter
- Battery may be over-discharged
- BMS may be locked (disconnect 10 min, retry)

**XL4015 getting hot:**
- Add heatsink ($2-3)
- Improve airflow
- Use separate converter per board
- Reduce brightness temporarily

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### LEDs Don't Light Up

1. **Check power supply**
   - Is 5V reaching LED boards?
   - Is GND connected between ESP32 and power supply?

2. **Check GPIO pin**
   - Verify correct GPIO number in code
   - Check physical connection to board

3. **Check LED type**
   - Must be WS2812B (or compatible)
   - Check `LED_TYPE` in code

### WiFi Connection Issues

1. **Can't see "LED_SIGN_AP" network**
   - Wait 30 seconds after power on
   - Check ESP32 serial monitor for errors
   - Verify ESP32 has power (USB or external 5V)

2. **Can't access http://ledsign.local**
   - Try IP address instead: http://192.168.4.1
   - Check if connected to LED_SIGN_AP network
   - Some devices don't support mDNS - use IP

### Display Issues

1. **Characters look wrong**
   - Verify NUM_SIGNS matches physical setup
   - Check LED matrix wiring (data flow direction)

2. **Scrolling is choppy**
   - Reduce scroll speed (higher ms value)
   - Check WiFi signal strength

3. **Colors are wrong**
   - Check `COLOR_ORDER` in code (should be GRB for WS2812B)
   - Some clones use RGB order
