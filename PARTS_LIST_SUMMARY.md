## 💡 Buying Tips

### Money Saving Tips:
1. Buy in bulk (cheaper per unit)
2. Check eBay (often half price)
3. Get foam locally (no shipping)
4. One wire kit = 5+ builds
5. Extra ESP32s = good spares

### What NOT to Compromise:
1. ⚠️ Battery quality (BMS required!)
2. ⚠️ LED strip (WS2812B only)
3. ⚠️ Wire gauge (22 AWG min data, 18 AWG power)
4. ⚠️ ESP32 authenticity (clones have WiFi issues)

### Best Value Strategy:
- Order all at once (save shipping)
- Get multi-packs (spares invaluable)
- Check eBay before Amazon (20-30% cheaper)
- Wait for sales (Prime Day, Black Friday)
- Bundle from same seller (combined shipping)
